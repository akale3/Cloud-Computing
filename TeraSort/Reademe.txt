This Readme.txt gives explanation of which file contains what. And command to execute different scenarios.

I. SharedMemory Sort.

Files and their explanation.
1. buil/jar/MapReduceTeraSort.jar --> compiled jar for program execution
2. resources/config.properties --> configuration file to change number of threads 
3. resources/TeraSort.log --> It shows the time taken by a program to sort a file.
4. build.xml --> it has all the configuration for building a jar file.
5. src/TeraSort.java --> its a main class of a Program.

To Run a Shared Memory Sorting.

1. Copy the SharedMemorySort folder to your home location.
   This folder has all required files of a project to execute a shared memory program.

2. Connect to an EC2 instance and send this above folder structure to that location using scp command.
   scp -i "PEM_File_NAme".pem -r "source_folder_path" ubuntu@"EC2_Instance_DNS":./

3. run a shell script SharedMemoryScript.sh for setting up environment on EC2.

4. Generate a file using gensort of desired memory (10GB, 100Gb)
   cd /aditya/SharedMemorySort/gensort-linux-1.5/64/
   ./gensort -a 100000000 10GBFile

5. Edit configuration settings in resouces/config.properties file.
   Change number of threads in a thread pool. 
   Manage total number of threads and number of lines in a chunk so that it equals to number of lines in a file.
   Specify the input file location.
   Specify destination folder location. 

6. Remove build folder if already existed.
   rm -r build

7. Run ant command to build a jar and run a program.
   ant

8. You can also run a jar using following command
   java -cp /build/jar/SharedMemoryTeraSort.jar edu.sort.TeraSot   

9. Your program will execute and a sorted file will be generated in your specified directory.
   TeraSort.log file will be generated in resources folder.

10. To validate a sorted file.
   cd /aditya/SharedMemorySort/gensort-linux-1.5/64/
   ./valsort 10GBFile


II. Hadoop MapReduce Sort.

Files and their explanation.
1. buil/jar/MapReduceTeraSort.jar --> compiled jar for program execution
3. MapReduceTeraSort.log --> It shows the time taken by a program to sort a file.
4. build.xml --> it has all the configuration for building a jar file.
5. src/TeraSort.java --> its a main class of a Program.

To Run a Hadoop Map Reduce sort.

1. Create a jar by compiling a hadoop program. Goto MapReduceSort folder.

2. Type ant command to compile a classes and create a jar.
   ant

3. Now Copy the MapReduceSort folder to your home location.
   This folder has all required files to execute a Map Reduce program on Amazon EC2 instance.

4. To run a Mapreduce task on your local machine.
   Generate a file using gensort. Follow same steps as described above
   Run following command to execute MapReduce Task.
   java -cp /build/jar/MapReduceTeraSort.jar edu.sort.TeraSot "source_file_path" "destination_file_path"  

5. To run a Mapreduce jar on Amazon Insatnces.
   Connect to an EC2 instance and send this above folder structure to that location using scp command.
   scp -i "PEM_File_NAme".pem -r "source_folder_path" ubuntu@"EC2_Instance_DNS":./

6. Follow the exact steps given in HadoopInstallationScript.sh to run a Hadoop Program on amazon EC2 instances.
   for 1 node and multi nodes.


III. Spark Sort.

Files and their explanation.
1. FileSort.scala --> This is a main class for sorting a file.

To Run a  sorting program on Spark.

1. Follow the exact steps given in sparkInstallationScript.sh to run a Spark Program on amazon EC2 insatnces.
